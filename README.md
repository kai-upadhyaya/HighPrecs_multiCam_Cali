This repository is associated with my Master's thesis at Institute for Factory Automation and Production Systems (Lehrstuhl für Fertigungsautomatisierung und Produktionssystematik - FAPS), Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in collaboration with Forschungs-Neutronenquelle Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (FRM II) as research partners and project owners.

Full source code of the algorithm will be uploaded and made open-source soon.

This repository will be updated with:
1. Full Source code
2. Algorithmic explanation with developer notes.
3. System architecture
4. Experimental insights

Current Status (As of 05/01/2026): Pending institutional approval for open-source.
